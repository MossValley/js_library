# Library

This is a simple 'library' table created using Javascript as part of The Odin Project's [Javascript Project: Library](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/library), focusing on the use of objects and object constructors.

Currently not hosted but can be run from a local machine in browser.

**Improvements**

Can be improved by 

* Changing up the CSS to make the table stand out more
* Structuring the form better
